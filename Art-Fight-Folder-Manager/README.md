# Art Fight Folder Manager

A powerful command-line tool designed to streamline your entire Art Fight workflow, from initial setup to final organization. Created to bring order to the wonderful chaos of the event.

## About The Tool

Art Fight is amazing, but managing dozens of targets, characters, Do's and Don'ts, and reference images can get messy. Folders become cluttered, and finding that one character ID you need is a pain.

**Art Fight Folder Manager** is an all-in-one `.bat` script that solves these problems. It guides you through a simple menu to create a clean, organized folder structure for every artist you plan to attack, so you can spend less time organizing and more time drawing.

## Features

- **Menu-Driven Interface:** Simple and easy to use. Just run the script and choose what you need to do.
- **Full User Setup:**
    - Automatically creates a main folder for each target artist.
    - Generates a `terms.txt` file after prompting you for their global "Do's" and "Don'ts".
    - Creates a direct URL shortcut to the user's Art Fight profile.
- **Detailed Character Management:**
    - Creates organized sub-folders for each individual character.
    - Generates a `description.txt` file to hold notes.
    - Creates a clickable `Copy_ID.bat` file in each character's folder to instantly copy their ID to your clipboard.
- **Powerful Image Organization:**
    - Scans the main folder for downloaded reference images (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, etc.).
    - Allows you to select one or **multiple images at once** to move.
    - Supports both space-separated (`1 3 4`) and range (`2-5`) selections.
    - Guides you to place the selected images into the correct user and character sub-folder with just a few keystrokes.
